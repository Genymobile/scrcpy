.SH NAME
scrcpy \- Display and control your Android device


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scrcpy
.RI [ options ]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B scrcpy
provides display and control of Android devices connected on USB (or over TCP/IP). It does not require any root access.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-\-always\-on\-top
Make scrcpy window always on top (above other windows).

.TP
.BI "\-\-angle " degrees
Rotate the video content by a custom angle, in degrees (clockwise).

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-bit\-rate " value
Encode the audio at the given bit rate, expressed in bits/s. Unit suffixes are supported: '\fBK\fR' (x1000) and '\fBM\fR' (x1000000).

Default is 128K (128000).

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-buffer " ms
Configure the audio buffering delay (in milliseconds).

Lower values decrease the latency, but increase the likelihood of buffer underrun (causing audio glitches).

Default is 50.

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-codec " name
Select an audio codec (opus, aac, flac or raw).

Default is opus.

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-codec\-options " key\fR[:\fItype\fR]=\fIvalue\fR[,...]
Set a list of comma-separated key:type=value options for the device audio encoder.

The possible values for 'type' are 'int' (default), 'long', 'float' and 'string'.

The list of possible codec options is available in the Android documentation:

<https://d.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaFormat>

.TP
.B \-\-audio\-dup
Duplicate audio (capture and keep playing on the device).

This feature is only available with --audio-source=playback.

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-encoder " name
Use a specific MediaCodec audio encoder (depending on the codec provided by \fB\-\-audio\-codec\fR).

The available encoders can be listed by \fB\-\-list\-encoders\fR.

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-source " source
Select the audio source (output, mic or playback).

The "output" source forwards the whole audio output, and disables playback on the device.

The "playback" source captures the audio playback (Android apps can opt-out, so the whole output is not necessarily captured).

The "mic" source captures the microphone.

Default is output.

.TP
.BI "\-\-audio\-output\-buffer " ms
Configure the size of the SDL audio output buffer (in milliseconds).

If you get "robotic" audio playback, you should test with a higher value (10). Do not change this setting otherwise.

Default is 5.

.TP
.BI "\-b, \-\-video\-bit\-rate " value
Encode the video at the given bit rate, expressed in bits/s. Unit suffixes are supported: '\fBK\fR' (x1000) and '\fBM\fR' (x1000000).

Default is 8M (8000000).

.TP
.BI "\-\-camera\-ar " ar
Select the camera size by its aspect ratio (+/- 10%).

Possible values are "sensor" (use the camera sensor aspect ratio), "\fInum\fR:\fIden\fR" (e.g. "4:3") and "\fIvalue\fR" (e.g. "1.6").

.TP
.BI "\-\-camera\-facing " facing
Select the device camera by its facing direction.

Possible values are "front", "back" and "external".

.TP
.BI "\-\-camera\-fps " fps
Specify the camera capture frame rate.

If not specified, Android's default frame rate (30 fps) is used.

.TP
.B \-\-camera\-high\-speed
Enable high-speed camera capture mode.

This mode is restricted to specific resolutions and frame rates, listed by \fB\-\-list\-camera\-sizes\fR.

.TP
.BI "\-\-camera\-id " id
Specify the device camera id to mirror.

The available camera ids can be listed by \fB\-\-list\-cameras\fR.

.TP
.BI "\-\-camera\-size " width\fRx\fIheight
Specify an explicit camera capture size.

.TP
.BI "\-\-capture\-orientation " value
Possible values are 0, 90, 180, 270, flip0, flip90, flip180 and flip270, possibly prefixed by '@'.

The number represents the clockwise rotation in degrees; the "flip" keyword applies a horizontal flip before the rotation.

If a leading '@' is passed (@90) for display capture, then the rotation is locked, and is relative to the natural device orientation.

If '@' is passed alone, then the rotation is locked to the initial device orientation.

Default is 0.

.TP
.BI "\-\-crop " width\fR:\fIheight\fR:\fIx\fR:\fIy
Crop the device screen on the server.

The values are expressed in the device natural orientation (typically, portrait for a phone, landscape for a tablet).

.TP
.B \-d, \-\-select\-usb
Use USB device (if there is exactly one, like adb -d).

Also see \fB\-e\fR (\fB\-\-select\-tcpip\fR).

.TP
.BI "\-\-disable\-screensaver"
Disable screensaver while scrcpy is running.

.TP
.BI "\-\-display\-id " id
Specify the device display id to mirror.

The available display ids can be listed by \fB\-\-list\-displays\fR.

Default is 0.

.TP
.BI "\-\-display\-orientation " value
Set the initial display orientation.

Possible values are 0, 90, 180, 270, flip0, flip90, flip180 and flip270. The number represents the clockwise rotation in degrees; the "flip" keyword applies a horizontal flip before the rotation.

Default is 0.

.TP
.B \-e, \-\-select\-tcpip
Use TCP/IP device (if there is exactly one, like adb -e).

Also see \fB\-d\fR (\fB\-\-select\-usb\fR).

.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fullscreen

Same as \fB\-\-gamepad=uhid\fR, or \fB\-\-keyboard=aoa\fR if \fB\-\-otg\fR is set.

.TP
.BI "\-\-gamepad " mode
Select how to send gamepad inputs to the device.

Possible values are "disabled", "uhid" and "aoa":

 - "disabled" does not send gamepad inputs to the device.
 - "uhid" simulates physical HID gamepads using the Linux HID kernel module on the device.
 - "aoa" simulates physical HID gamepads using the AOAv2 protocol. It may only work over USB.

Also see \fB\-\-keyboard\f and R\fB\-\-mouse\fR.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print this help.

.TP
.B \-K
Same as \fB\-\-keyboard=uhid\fR, or \fB\-\-keyboard=aoa\fR if \fB\-\-otg\fR is set.

.TP
.BI "\-\-keyboard " mode
Select how to send keyboard inputs to the device.

Possible values are "disabled", "sdk", "uhid" and "aoa":

 - "disabled" does not send keyboard inputs to the device.
 - "sdk" uses the Android system API to deliver keyboard events to applications.
 - "uhid" simulates a physical HID keyboard using the Linux HID kernel module on the device.
 - "aoa" simulates a physical HID keyboard using the AOAv2 protocol. It may only work over USB.

For "uhid" and "aoa", the keyboard layout must be configured (once and for all) on the device, via Settings -> System -> Languages and input -> Physical keyboard. This settings page can be started directly using the shortcut MOD+k (except in OTG mode), or by executing:

    adb shell am start -a android.settings.HARD_KEYBOARD_SETTINGS

This option is only available when the HID keyboard is enabled (or a physical keyboard is connected).

Also see \fB\-\-mouse\fR and \fB\-\-gamepad\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-kill\-adb\-on\-close
Kill adb when scrcpy terminates.

.TP
.B \-\-legacy\-paste

List Android apps installed on the device.

.TP
.B \-\-list\-camera\-sizes
List the valid camera capture sizes.

.TP
.B \-\-list\-cameras

Default is 0 (unlimited).

.TP
.B \-M
Same as \fB\-\-mouse=uhid\fR, or \fB\-\-mouse=aoa\fR if \fB\-\-otg\fR is set.

.TP
.BI "\-\-max\-fps " value
Limit the framerate of screen capture (officially supported since Android 10, but may work on earlier versions).

.TP
.BI "\-\-mouse " mode
Select how to send mouse inputs to the device.

Possible values are "disabled", "sdk", "uhid" and "aoa":

 - "disabled" does not send mouse inputs to the device.
 - "sdk" uses the Android system API to deliver mouse events to applications.
 - "uhid" simulates a physical HID mouse using the Linux HID kernel module on the device.
 - "aoa" simulates a physical mouse using the AOAv2 protocol. It may only work over USB.

In "uhid" and "aoa" modes, the computer mouse is captured to control the device directly (relative mouse mode).

LAlt, LSuper or RSuper toggle the capture mode, to give control of the mouse back to the computer.

Also see \fB\-\-keyboard\fR and \fB\-\-gamepad\fR.

.TP
.BI "\-\-mouse\-bind " xxxx[:xxxx]
Configure bindings of secondary clicks.

The argument must be one or two sequences (separated by ':') of exactly 4 characters, one for each secondary click (in order: right click, middle click, 4th click, 5th click).

The first sequence defines the primary bindings, used when a mouse button is pressed alone. The second sequence defines the secondary bindings, used when a mouse button is pressed while the Shift key is held.

If the second sequence of bindings is omitted, then it is the same as the first one.

Each character must be one of the following:

 - '+': forward the click to the device
 - '-': ignore the click
 - 'b': trigger shortcut BACK (or turn screen on if off)
 - 'h': trigger shortcut HOME
 - 's': trigger shortcut APP_SWITCH
 - 'n': trigger shortcut "expand notification panel"

Default is 'bhsn:++++' for SDK mouse, and '++++:bhsn' for AOA and UHID.


.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no\-control
Disable device control (mirror the device in read\-only).

.TP
.B \-N, \-\-no\-playback
Disable video and audio playback on the computer (equivalent to \fB\-\-no\-video\-playback \-\-no\-audio\-playback\fR).

.TP
\fB\-\-new\-display\fR[=[\fIwidth\fRx\fIheight\fR][/\fIdpi\fR]]
Create a new display with the specified resolution and density. If not provided, they default to the main display dimensions and DPI.

Examples:

    \-\-new\-display=1920x1080
    \-\-new\-display=1920x1080/420
    \-\-new\-display         # main display size and density
    \-\-new\-display=/240    # main display size and 240 dpi

.TP
.B \-\-no\-audio
Disable audio forwarding.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-audio\-playback
Disable audio playback on the computer.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-cleanup
By default, scrcpy removes the server binary from the device and restores the device state (show touches, stay awake and power mode) on exit.

This option disables this cleanup.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-clipboard\-autosync
By default, scrcpy automatically synchronizes the computer clipboard to the device clipboard before injecting Ctrl+v, and the device clipboard to the computer clipboard whenever it changes.

This option disables this automatic synchronization.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-downsize\-on\-error
By default, on MediaCodec error, scrcpy automatically tries again with a lower definition.

This option disables this behavior.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-key\-repeat
Do not forward repeated key events when a key is held down.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-mipmaps
If the renderer is OpenGL 3.0+ or OpenGL ES 2.0+, then mipmaps are automatically generated to improve downscaling quality. This option disables the generation of mipmaps.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-mouse\-hover
Do not forward mouse hover (mouse motion without any clicks) events.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-power\-on
Do not power on the device on start.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-vd\-destroy\-content
Disable virtual display "destroy content on removal" flag.

With this option, when the virtual display is closed, the running apps are moved to the main display rather than being destroyed.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-vd\-system\-decorations
Disable virtual display system decorations flag.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-video
Disable video forwarding.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-video\-playback
Disable video playback on the computer.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-window
Disable scrcpy window. Implies --no-video-playback and --no-control.

.TP
.BI "\-\-orientation " value
Same as --display-orientation=value --record-orientation=value.

.TP
.B \-\-otg
Run in OTG mode: simulate physical keyboard and mouse, as if the computer keyboard and mouse were plugged directly to the device via an OTG cable.

In this mode, adb (USB debugging) is not necessary, and mirroring is disabled.

LAlt, LSuper or RSuper toggle the mouse capture mode, to give control of the mouse back to the computer.

If any of \fB\-\-hid\-keyboard\fR or \fB\-\-hid\-mouse\fR is set, only enable keyboard or mouse respectively, otherwise enable both.

It may only work over USB.

See \fB\-\-keyboard\fR, \fB\-\-mouse\fR and \fB\-\-gamepad\fR.

.TP
.BI "\-p, \-\-port " port\fR[:\fIport\fR]
Set the TCP port (range) used by the client to listen.

Default is 27183:27199.

.TP
\fB\-\-pause\-on\-exit\fR[=\fImode\fR]
Configure pause on exit. Possible values are "true" (always pause on exit), "false" (never pause on exit) and "if-error" (pause only if an error occurred).

This is useful to prevent the terminal window from automatically closing, so that error messages can be read.

Default is "false".

Passing the option without argument is equivalent to passing "true".

.TP
.B \-\-power\-off\-on\-close
Turn the device screen off when closing scrcpy.

.TP
.B \-\-prefer\-text
Inject alpha characters and space as text events instead of key events.

This avoids issues when combining multiple keys to enter special characters,
but breaks the expected behavior of alpha keys in games (typically WASD).

.TP
.B "\-\-print\-fps
Start FPS counter, to print framerate logs to the console. It can be started or stopped at any time with MOD+i.

.TP
.BI "\-\-push\-target " path
Set the target directory for pushing files to the device by drag & drop. It is passed as\-is to "adb push".

Default is "/sdcard/Download/".

Record screen to
.IR file .

The format is determined by the
.B \-\-record\-format
option if set, or by the file extension.

.TP
.B \-\-raw\-key\-events
Inject key events for all input keys, and ignore text events.

.TP
.BI "\-\-record\-format " format
Force recording format (mp4, mkv, m4a, mka, opus, aac, flac or wav).

.TP
.BI "\-\-record\-orientation " value
Set the record orientation.

Possible values are 0, 90, 180 and 270. The number represents the clockwise rotation in degrees.

Default is 0.

.TP

Request SDL to use the given render driver (this is just a hint).

Supported names are currently "direct3d", "opengl", "opengles2", "opengles", "metal" and "software".

<https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_HINT_RENDER_DRIVER>

.TP
.B \-\-require\-audio
By default, scrcpy mirrors only the video if audio capture fails on the device. This option makes scrcpy fail if audio is enabled but does not work.

.TP
.BI "\-s, \-\-serial " number
The device serial number. Mandatory only if several devices are connected to adb.

.TP
.B \-S, \-\-turn\-screen\-off
Turn the device screen off immediately.

.TP
.BI "\-\-shortcut\-mod " key\fR[+...]][,...]
Specify the modifiers to use for scrcpy shortcuts. Possible keys are "lctrl", "rctrl", "lalt", "ralt", "lsuper" and "rsuper".

Several shortcut modifiers can be specified, separated by ','.

For example, to use either LCtrl or LSuper for scrcpy shortcuts, pass "lctrl,lsuper".

Default is "lalt,lsuper" (left-Alt or left-Super).

.TP
.BI "\-\-start\-app " name
Start an Android app, by its exact package name.

Add a '?' prefix to select an app whose name starts with the given name, case-insensitive (retrieving app names on the device may take some time):

    scrcpy --start-app=?firefox

Add a '+' prefix to force-stop before starting the app:

    scrcpy --new-display --start-app=+org.mozilla.firefox

Both prefixes can be used, in that order:

    scrcpy --start-app=+?firefox

.TP
.B \-t, \-\-show\-touches
Enable "show touches" on start, restore the initial value on exit.

It only shows physical touches (not clicks from scrcpy).

.TP
.BI "\-\-tcpip\fR[=[+]\fIip\fR[:\fIport\fR]]
Configure and connect the device over TCP/IP.

If a destination address is provided, then scrcpy connects to this address before starting. The device must listen on the given TCP port (default is 5555).

If no destination address is provided, then scrcpy attempts to find the IP address and adb port of the current device (typically connected over USB), enables TCP/IP mode if necessary, then connects to this address before starting.

Prefix the address with a '+' to force a reconnection.

.TP
.BI "\-\-time\-limit " seconds
Set the maximum mirroring time, in seconds.

.TP
.BI "\-\-tunnel\-host " ip
Set the IP address of the adb tunnel to reach the scrcpy server. This option automatically enables \fB\-\-force\-adb\-forward\fR.

Default is localhost.

.TP
.BI "\-\-tunnel\-port " port
Set the TCP port of the adb tunnel to reach the scrcpy server. This option automatically enables \fB\-\-force\-adb\-forward\fR.

Default is 0 (not forced): the local port used for establishing the tunnel will be used.

.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Print the version of scrcpy.

.TP
.BI "\-V, \-\-verbosity " value

.BI "\-\-v4l2-sink " /dev/videoN
Output to v4l2loopback device.

.TP
.BI "\-\-v4l2-buffer " ms
Add a buffering delay (in milliseconds) before pushing frames. This increases latency to compensate for jitter.

This option is similar to \fB\-\-video\-buffer\fR, but specific to V4L2 sink.

Default is 0 (no buffering).

.TP
.BI "\-\-video\-buffer " ms
Add a buffering delay (in milliseconds) before displaying video frames.

This increases latency to compensate for jitter.

Default is 0 (no buffering).

.TP
.BI "\-\-video\-codec " name
