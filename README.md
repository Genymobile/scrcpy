# scrcpy (v3.3.4)

<img src="app/data/icon.svg" width="128" height="128" alt="scrcpy" align="right" />

_pronounced "**scr**een **c**o**py**"_

This application mirrors Android devices (video and audio) connected via USB or
[TCP/IP](doc/connection.md#tcpip-wireless) and allows control using the
computer's keyboard and mouse. It does not require _root_ access or an app
installed on the device. It works on _Linux_, _Windows_, and _macOS_.

![screenshot](assets/screenshot-debian-600.jpg)

It focuses on:

 - **lightness**: native, displays only the device screen
 - **performance**: 30~120fps, depending on the device
 - **quality**: 1920×1080 or above
 - **low latency**: [35~70ms][lowlatency]
 - **low startup time**: ~1 second to display the first image
 - **non-intrusiveness**: nothing is left installed on the Android device
 - **user benefits**: no account, no ads, no internet required
 - **freedom**: free and open source software

[lowlatency]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/pull/646

Its features include:
 - [audio forwarding](doc/audio.md) (Android 11+)
 - [recording](doc/recording.md)
 - [virtual display](doc/virtual_display.md)
 - mirroring with [Android device screen off](doc/device.md#turn-screen-off)
 - [copy-paste](doc/control.md#copy-paste) in both directions
 - [configurable quality](doc/video.md)
 - [camera mirroring](doc/camera.md) (Android 12+)
 - [mirroring as a webcam (V4L2)](doc/v4l2.md) (Linux-only)
 - physical [keyboard][hid-keyboard] and [mouse][hid-mouse] simulation (HID)
 - [gamepad](doc/gamepad.md) support
 - [OTG mode](doc/otg.md)
 - and more…

[hid-keyboard]: doc/keyboard.md#physical-keyboard-simulation
[hid-mouse]: doc/mouse.md#physical-mouse-simulation

## Prerequisites

The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

[Audio forwarding](doc/audio.md) is supported for API >= 30 (Android 11+).

Make sure you [enabled USB debugging][enable-adb] on your device(s).

[enable-adb]: https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable

On some devices (especially Xiaomi), you might get the following error:

```
Injecting input events requires the caller (or the source of the instrumentation, if any) to have the INJECT_EVENTS permission.
```

In that case, you need to enable [an additional option][control] `USB debugging
(Security Settings)` (this is an item different from `USB debugging`) to control
it using a keyboard and mouse. Rebooting the device is necessary once this
option is set.

[control]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/70#issuecomment-373286323

Note that USB debugging is not required to run scrcpy in [OTG mode](doc/otg.md).


## Get the app

 - [Linux](doc/linux.md)
 - [Windows](doc/windows.md) (read [how to run](doc/windows.md#run))
 - [macOS](doc/macos.md)

## Fork features (this repo)

This fork adds a small toolbar above the mirrored device screen with four
buttons (left → right):

 1. **Dump full system logs** — runs `adb logcat -d -b all` and writes the
    output to `~/Downloads/scrcpy_syslogs_<timestamp>.txt`. Unfiltered, all
    buffers (main, system, crash, events, radio, …).
 2. **Dump foreground-app logs** — runs `adb logcat -d --pid=$(adb shell pidof
    <foreground-pkg>)` and writes to
    `~/Downloads/scrcpy_logs_<timestamp>.txt`. Falls back to the full buffer
    if the foreground package can't be detected.
 3. **Open live logcat** — opens a Terminal window streaming `adb logcat
    --pid=…` for the foreground app (same as `Ctrl+Shift+L`).
 4. **Screenshot** — saves a PNG to `~/Downloads/scrcpy_<timestamp>.png` **and
    copies it to the system clipboard** so you can paste it straight into
    Slack/Messages/etc. (same as `Ctrl+Shift+S`).

All dumps are point-in-time snapshots of the device's in-memory log ring
buffers; older entries that have already been overwritten are not recoverable
(Android doesn't persist logs to disk). Run `adb logcat -g` to see the exact
buffer sizes on your device.

### macOS: launch scrcpy from the Dock

A minimal `Scrcpy.app` bundle lets you launch the build from the Dock without
opening a terminal. To set it up after cloning and building (`meson setup
build && ninja -C build`):

```bash
# 1. Create the .app skeleton
mkdir -p "/Applications/Scrcpy.app/Contents/MacOS" \
         "/Applications/Scrcpy.app/Contents/Resources"

# 2. Info.plist
cat > "/Applications/Scrcpy.app/Contents/Info.plist" <<'PLIST'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>CFBundleExecutable</key><string>scrcpy-launcher</string>
    <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key><string>com.local.scrcpy</string>
    <key>CFBundleName</key><string>Scrcpy</string>
    <key>CFBundleDisplayName</key><string>Scrcpy</string>
    <key>CFBundleVersion</key><string>1.0</string>
    <key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key><string>1.0</string>
    <key>CFBundlePackageType</key><string>APPL</string>
    <key>CFBundleIconFile</key><string>icon</string>
</dict>
</plist>
PLIST

# 3. Launcher script — edit the cd path and PATH to match your setup.
#    PATH must include adb (Finder-launched apps don't inherit your shell PATH).
cat > "/Applications/Scrcpy.app/Contents/MacOS/scrcpy-launcher" <<'SH'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH"
cd "$HOME/scrcpy"          # ← adjust to where you cloned this repo
exec ./run build "$@"
SH
chmod +x "/Applications/Scrcpy.app/Contents/MacOS/scrcpy-launcher"

# 4. Icon (converts the repo icon to .icns)
cp app/data/icon.png "/Applications/Scrcpy.app/Contents/Resources/icon.png"
sips -s format icns "/Applications/Scrcpy.app/Contents/Resources/icon.png" \
     --out "/Applications/Scrcpy.app/Contents/Resources/icon.icns"

# 5. Refresh Finder's icon cache, then launch once
touch /Applications/Scrcpy.app
open /Applications/Scrcpy.app
```

Once it's running, right-click the Dock icon → **Options → Keep in Dock** to
pin it. From then on, clicking the Dock icon runs `./run build` from the repo
and opens the mirrored device window.

If the Dock icon "opens and immediately quits", it usually means `adb` isn't
on the `PATH` baked into the launcher — edit `scrcpy-launcher` and add the
directory where `which adb` points.


## Must-know tips

 - [Reducing resolution](doc/video.md#size) may greatly improve performance
   (`scrcpy -m1024`)
 - [_Right-click_](doc/mouse.md#mouse-bindings) triggers `BACK`
 - [_Middle-click_](doc/mouse.md#mouse-bindings) triggers `HOME`
 - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> toggles [fullscreen](doc/window.md#fullscreen)
 - There are many other [shortcuts](doc/shortcuts.md)


## Usage examples

There are a lot of options, [documented](#user-documentation) in separate pages.
Here are just some common examples.

 - Capture the screen in H.265 (better quality), limit the size to 1920, limit
   the frame rate to 60fps, disable audio, and control the device by simulating
   a physical keyboard:

    ```bash
    scrcpy --video-codec=h265 --max-size=1920 --max-fps=60 --no-audio --keyboard=uhid
    scrcpy --video-codec=h265 -m1920 --max-fps=60 --no-audio -K  # short version
    ```

 - Start VLC in a new virtual display (separate from the device display):

    ```bash
    scrcpy --new-display=1920x1080 --start-app=org.videolan.vlc
    ```

 - Record the device camera in H.265 at 1920x1080 (and microphone) to an MP4
   file:

    ```bash
    scrcpy --video-source=camera --video-codec=h265 --camera-size=1920x1080 --record=file.mp4
    ```

 - Capture the device front camera and expose it as a webcam on the computer (on
   Linux):

    ```bash
    scrcpy --video-source=camera --camera-size=1920x1080 --camera-facing=front --v4l2-sink=/dev/video2 --no-playback
    ```

 - Control the device without mirroring by simulating a physical keyboard and
   mouse (USB debugging not required):

    ```bash
    scrcpy --otg
    ```

 - Control the device using gamepad controllers plugged into the computer:

    ```bash
    scrcpy --gamepad=uhid
    scrcpy -G  # short version
    ```
