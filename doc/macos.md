# On macOS

## Install

Scrcpy is available in [Homebrew]:

```bash
brew install scrcpy
```

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/

You need `adb`, accessible from your `PATH`. If you don't have it yet:

```bash
brew install android-platform-tools
```

Alternatively, Scrcpy is also available in [MacPorts], which sets up `adb` for you:

```bash
sudo port install scrcpy
```

[MacPorts]: https://www.macports.org/

_See [build.md](build.md) to build and install the app manually._


## Run

_Make sure that your device meets the [prerequisites](/README.md#prerequisites)._

Once installed, run from a terminal:

```bash
scrcpy
```

or with arguments (here to disable audio and record to `file.mkv`):

```bash
scrcpy --no-audio --record=file.mkv
```

Documentation for command line arguments is available:
 - `man scrcpy`
 - `scrcpy --help`
 - on [github](/README.md)
